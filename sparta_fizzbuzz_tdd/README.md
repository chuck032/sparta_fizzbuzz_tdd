### Details of this project

For this project we were required to create our very own FizzBuzz using Ruby. FizzBuzz is essentially an array of numbers going from 1-100, where

* multiples of 3 are replaced with the word 'Fizz'.
* multiples of 5 are replaced with the word 'Buzz'.
* multiples of both 5 and 3 are replaced with the word 'FizzBuzz'.

An essential requirement for this project is creating this in ruby code using Object Orientated Programming. Once this was complete I can than test the object/class method using the Rspec gem.

I then made sure I initialised the class method inherited from the engine.rb file before writing tests, using the before(:each) line.

I then proceeded to create loops to run the tests throughout the array for each of the Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz.
